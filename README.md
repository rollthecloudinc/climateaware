# ClimateAware.eco

An Initiative by Roll The Cloud Inc. for Eco-friendly Web and App Development

## Project Description
 
Welcome to ClimateAware.eco! This project is a mission by Roll The Cloud Inc., a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, to make the digital world more sustainable. ClimateAware.eco is an eco-friendly, wallet-friendly solution for the rapid, low code creation of websites and apps.

Climate change is a global crisis that demands our immediate attention. In the digital industry, we have a significant role to play in mitigating its effects. Traditional web and app development can come with a considerable carbon footprint, and that's where ClimateAware.eco comes in.

Our Platform as a Service (PAS) is designed to empower individuals, non-profit organizations, start-ups, and small to medium businesses to establish an online presence that is cost-effective, user-friendly, and eco-conscious.

## How ClimateAware.eco Works
 
ClimateAware.eco provides accessible tools for creating intuitive, attractive websites and apps with minimal technical expertise. We take care of the hosting, offer comprehensive customer support, and provide educational resources to guide you through the process.

Above all, ClimateAware.eco is built with a focus on sustainability. We've optimized our platform to minimize its carbon footprint, ensuring you can develop your digital presence while contributing to a sustainable future.

We need your help to bring ClimateAware.eco to life. We aim to raise $500,000 to cover the initial development, marketing, and operational expenses for the first two years. As a 501(c)3 organization, we are reliant on the generosity of donors like you.

You can contribute by making a donation via our GoFundMe campaign or by contributing your time and expertise to the development of ClimateAware.eco.
